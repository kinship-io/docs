---

You can prevent models from being tracked in Kinship by setting a Model Sync Rule to **Never**.
This guide shows how to block automatic tracking for specific models, folders, or all new models.

---

## Blocking Models with a “Never” Rule

1. **Go to Settings**
   Log in to Kinship and open **Settings** from your user menu.
2. **Open Model Sync Rules**
   Scroll to the **Model Sync Rules** section.
3. **Add a new rule**
   - Click **Add Rule**.
   - In the pattern field, enter the path or filename you want to block (e.g., `*\etransmit\*` or `*confidential*`).
   - Select **Never** as the action.
   - Click **Add** to save the rule.

> **Tip:**
> Only administrators can override “Never” rules and add blocked models manually.

## Blocking All New Models by Default

You can use a catch-all rule with pattern `*` and action **Never** to control when models are tracked.
Where you place this rule in your list changes its effect:

---

### Block All Except Allowed Folders

To prevent all new models from being tracked **except those you explicitly allow**:

1. Add a rule with the folder(s) you want to allow (e.g., `*\ActiveProjects\*`), set to **Auto Public** (or your preferred action).
2. Add a rule with pattern `*` and action **Never**.
3. Move the “Never” rule to the **bottom** of your rule list.

        alt="Block All Except Allowed Folders"
    />
</Frame>

### Block All Model Tracking

If you need to **block all new model tracking immediately**:

1. Add a rule with pattern `*` and action **Never**.
2. Move this rule to the **top** of your rule list.

<Frame
  caption="With this rule at the top, all model tracking is blocked, regardless of any other rules below.">
    <img
        className="block"
        src="/images/model-sync-rules-block-all-models.png"
        alt="Block All Model Tracking"
    />
</Frame>

> You don’t need to delete or change your existing rules—just move or remove the catch-all rule when you’re ready to resume normal tracking.

**Note:** Administrators can still add models manually using the Model Sync Status menu in the add-in.

## What Happens Next?

- Kinship will now ignore any models matching your “Never” rules.
- Blocked models will not show a prompt for users to add them.
- Admins can still override this using the Model Sync Status menu in the add-in.
