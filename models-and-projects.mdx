Managing multiple Revit files can be tricky—especially when a real project involves several related models. Kinship makes this easier by organizing your **Revit models** into **projects** that reflect how your teams actually collaborate. This structure gives you a clear, unified view of all your project files, their history, and their content—all in one place.

## What Are Models and Projects?

- **Models**: In Kinship, a model is any Revit file (RVT) your team works on.
- **Projects**: A project is a collection of related models that belong together—usually because they’re part of the same real-world job or client work.

Instead of treating every Revit file as a separate item, Kinship brings related models together into projects so you can see the big picture, track progress, and manage access across your team.

## How Does Kinship Organize Your Files?

Whenever you use **Synchronize with Central** (SwC) on a workshared Revit file, Kinship steps in:

- It registers the model and gathers key info like its name, file path, and project details.
- Kinship tries to match the model to an existing project by looking at things like file names, BIM 360 project info, or where the central file is stored.
- If there’s no clear match, Kinship creates a new project for you or keeps the model “Unassigned” until you organize it.

This automatic grouping means you spend less time sorting files and more time designing.

## Working with Projects: Public and Restricted

Not every project should be visible to everyone. That’s why Kinship supports both **public** and **restricted** projects:

- **Public projects**: Any team member can see and access these projects and their models.
- **Restricted projects**: Only admins and users who have actually worked on (synced with) one of the project’s models can view them. These projects are clearly marked with a blue lock icon for easy spotting.

This approach keeps sensitive work private, while still letting the right people collaborate.

---

## Why Organize This Way?

- **Clarity**: See all the related models for a project together, along with their changes and history.
- **Control**: Easily manage who can access what, and keep private work confidential.
- **Convenience**: Automatic project matching saves you setup time and helps avoid mistakes.

## Quick Recap

| Term            | What it Means in Kinship                         |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**       | A single Revit file your team works on           |
| **Project**     | A group of related models for a single job or client     |
| **Public**      | Visible to your whole Kinship team               |
| **Restricted**  | Only for admins (or security admins if enabled) and those who’ve worked on it    |
