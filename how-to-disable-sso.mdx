At any point, a Kinship Administrator can disable the Entra ID SSO. It can be reactivated at later. While SSO is disabled, users will sign in with their email and a verification code. 

You can re-enable SSO at any time by following the steps in [How to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Entra ID](how-to-enable-sso).


## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have access to a Kinship Administrator account.

## Steps to Disable SSO

If you ever need to turn SSO off:

1. Sign in to Kinship as an Administrator.
