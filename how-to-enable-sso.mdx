Single Sign-On (SSO) lets your team access Kinship with their existing Microsoft Entra ID (Active Directory) credentials. Once enabled, users can sign in seamlessly—either directly through the website or automatically in the Revit add-in (if their machine is registered with your AD domain).

At any time, you can disable SSO by following the steps in [How to disable Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Entra ID](how-to-disable-sso) and re-enable it later if needed.


## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A Microsoft Entra tenant.
- A Kinship subscription with SSO enabled.
- Access to a Kinship Administrator account.
- Access to a Microsoft Entra Administrator account.

## Permissions Requested

When you enable SSO, Kinship will ask your Entra ID Administrator to grant permission to:
- Sign in and read user profiles
- Read all groups

## Steps to Enable SSO

1. **Sign in to Kinship**
   Log in to your Kinship team as an Administrator.

2. **Open Settings**
