Your team in Kinship includes all the users who need access to shared content, models, and tools. Users can only access Kinship once they’ve joined your team, either by signing in with their work email or by creating an account based on it.

Once added, users can view and work with your team’s content based on the role and permissions assigned to them.

To learn more about what users can see and do, see User Roles and Permissions.


## How Users Join the Team

The way users join your team depends on your signup settings and whether your team uses **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:

- **With SSO**:
  Users are asked to sign in with your organization’s identity provider. Their profile information in Kinship is filled automatically based on the details from the identity provider.

  In the case of Entra ID, a profile can also be created automatically without a sign-in step if the user has the Kinship add-in installed on a machine registered to Active Directory. In that situation, the add-in connects automatically and the user’s profile information is filled in the same way as if they had signed in with the identity provider.

- **Without SSO**:
  Users can join your team in two ways:
  - By accepting an invitation from you or another team admin
  - By registering themselves, if their email domain is allowed

You can control whether users must be invited, or if they can self-register from specific domains. These settings are covered in [Signup Modes and User Registration](#).
