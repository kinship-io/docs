Your team in Kinship includes everyone who needs access to the shared content, tools, and features that Kinship provides. Users can only access Kinship once they’ve joined your team — either by signing in with their work email or by creating an account based on it.

This document gives you a high-level view of how user access works, and how users become part of your team.


## Users in Your Team

A team can include many users, and each one must be registered before gaining access to team content, models, and analytics. Once a user joins your team, they can work with shared resources and information, with their level of access defined by the role and permissions assigned to them. Each user’s profile in Kinship is linked to their work email, ensuring that access remains secure and unique to them. For more detail on what users can do, see [User Roles and Permissions](#).


## How Users Join the Team

The way users join your team depends on your signup settings and whether your team uses **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:

- **With SSO**:
  Users are asked to sign in with your organization’s identity provider. Their profile information in Kinship is filled automatically based on the details from the identity provider.

  In the case of Entra ID, a profile can also be created automatically without a sign-in step if the user has the Kinship add-in installed on a machine registered to Active Directory. In that situation, the add-in connects automatically and the user’s profile information is filled in the same way as if they had signed in with the identity provider.

- **Without SSO**:
  Users can join your team in two ways:
  - By accepting an invitation from you or another team admin
  - By registering themselves, if their email domain is allowed

You can control whether users must be invited, or if they can self-register from specific domains. These settings are covered in [Signup Modes and User Registration](#).
