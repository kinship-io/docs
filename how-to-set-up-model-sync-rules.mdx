Model Sync Rules are managed from the Settings area in Kinship.
Follow the steps below to access and update your team’s rules.

## Viewing Model Sync Rules

1. **Log in** to Kinship on the web.
2. Click your user icon in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.
3. Scroll to the **Model Sync Rules** section.

---

## Creating a New Rule

1. Click **Add Rule**.
2. In the dialog, enter a **path** or **filename pattern** (e.g., `*\eTransmit\*` or `*secret*`).
3. Choose the desired **action**:
    | Action           | What it does                                                                                 |
    |:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Never**        | Never add matching models to Kinship. Users aren’t prompted. Only admins can override.       |
    | **Auto Restricted** | Automatically add matching models as **restricted** (new restricted project).                      |
    | **Auto Public**  | Automatically add matching models as **public** (assigned to a project or left unassigned).  |
    | **Ask User**     | Show the default Kinship prompt (user decides, can set privacy).                             |
4. Click **Add** to save the rule.



> **Tip:** Patterns must match either a path or a filename, but not both. See the [overview](model-sync-rules) for pattern examples.

## Editing a Rule

1. Find the rule you want to change in the rules list.
2. Click the **edit (blue pencil)** button for that rule.
3. Update the pattern and/or action.
4. Click **Save**.

---

## Reordering Rules

- Click the **Edit Rules** button to enter editing mode.
- Use the **drag handle** (≡) on the left of each rule to move it up or down.
- Click **Done** to save the new order.

> **Note:** Rules are processed top to bottom; only the first matching rule applies.

---

## Deleting a Rule

1. Enter **editing mode** by clicking the **Edit Rules** button.
2. Click the **red minus (–)** button next to the rule you wish to remove.
3. Click **Done** to confirm and exit editing mode.

---

## Finishing Up

Your Model Sync Rules will now apply automatically to **new models** as they are tracked in Kinship.
**Note:** These rules only affect models that are added after the rules are set up—existing models already tracked in Kinship will not be changed.

Remember: the **order of rules matters**—review your list to make sure it reflects your team’s needs.
