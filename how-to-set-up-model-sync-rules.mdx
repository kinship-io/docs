## Creating a New Rule

1. Click **Add Rule**.
2. In the dialog, enter a **path** or **filename pattern** (e.g., `*\eTransmit\*` or `*secret*`).
3. Choose the desired **action**:
    | Action              | What it does                                                                                |
    | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Never**           | Never add matching models to Kinship. Users aren’t prompted. Only admins can override.      |
    | **Auto Restricted** | Automatically add matching models as **restricted**.                                        |
    | **Auto Public**     | Automatically add matching models as **public** (assigned to a project or left unassigned). |
    | **Ask User**        | Show the default Kinship prompt (user decides, can set privacy).                            |
4. Click **Add** to save the rule.

## Reordering Rules

- Click the **Edit** button to enter editing mode.

- Click **Done** to save the new order.

> **Note:** Rules are processed top to bottom; only the first matching rule applies.

## Finishing Up

Your Model Sync Rules will now apply automatically to **new models** as they are tracked in Kinship.

> **Note:** These rules only affect models that are added after the rules are set up—existing models already tracked in Kinship will not be changed.

Remember: the **order of rules matters**—review your list to make sure it reflects your team’s needs.
