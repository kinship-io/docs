Tracking models in Kinship lets you monitor and manage Revit central files across your teams and projects. Once a model is tracked, Kinship collects metadata (file size, Revit version, central file location), extracts families, sync history, and usage information—all of which surface in the web portal for analytics and troubleshooting.

 **Note:** Kinship does not host the central file itself. The file remains in its current location. Kinship gathers data from the model so you can view and manage it from the website.

## Why Track Models in Kinship?

Tracking models in Kinship gives you visibility into model health, usage, and team activity across all your projects. The insights help your team optimize performance, maintain consistency, and support Revit environments at scale.

- **Model health metrics:** Stay informed about sync-with-central timing, warnings, corrupt families, failed syncs, file size bloat, and other indicators.
- **Device & crash data:** Access device details, Revit versions, crash logs, and journal data to quickly diagnose and resolve issues—often without needing direct user reports.
- **Version tracking:** Maintain consistent Revit versions across teams and projects.
- **Usage analytics:** See how and where content is placed or modified to identify gaps in your library and understand real usage patterns.
