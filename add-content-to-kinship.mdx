title: "How to Add Revit Content to Kinship"
description: "Learn how to upload Revit families, schedules, and view templates to your Kinship library using the Revit add-in, whether from existing project models or external files and folders."
---

Kinship processes content extracting parameters, thumbnails, and essential metadata.

You can upload content using two primary methods:
1. From your Revit model – Add families and other elements that exist in your current project.
2. From files or folders – Add families from external .RFA files, including those organized in folders and subfolders.

Adding content to your library will make it available to all users on your team. Start by opening the **Add-Ins** tab in the Revit ribbon, and on the **Kinship** panel, select one of the options under **Add to Library**.

## Adding Content from Your Revit Model

To add content directly from an open Revit model:

## Options When Adding Single vs Multiple Items

When confirming your upload, the options will differ depending on the number of items found or selected:

- **Single Item**  
  You will see a dialog where you can rename the item, add comments, and optionally mark it as **pending approval** before clicking **Add to Library**.

- **Multiple Items**  
  You will see a dialog showing the number of items found, with options to:  
  - **Add to Library** – Adds all items to your library.  
  - **Add to new or existing lists** – Create or select lists to add the items to.
