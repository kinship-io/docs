SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) lets you automatically sync users and groups between Microsoft Entra ID and Kinship. Once set up, user management becomes seamlessâ€”no more manual updates.

<Note>
Before you start make sure youâ€™ve already generated the SCIM token in for your Kinship team. See how to [obtain your SCIM Token](#)

## Steps to set up user provisioning.

### 1. Create an Enterprise Application in Entra ID

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](#).
2. Go to **Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications**.
3. Select **+ New application**.
4. Choose **Create your own application**.
5. Enter a name (for example, *Kinship Provisioning*).
6. Select **Integrate any other application you donâ€™t find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**.
7. Click **Create**.

### 2. Configure SCIM Provisioning

1. In your new Enterprise Application, go to **Provisioning** in the left menu.
2. Under **Provisioning Mode**, select **Automatic**.
3. Under **Admin Credentials**:
   - Enter your **Kinship Tenant URL** in the *Tenant URL* field.  
     ðŸ‘‰ [How to find your Tenant URL](#)  
   - Enter your **SCIM token** in the *Secret Token* field.
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify.

### 3. Enable User and Group Provisioning

1. Once the connection is successful, click **Save**.
2. Under **Mappings**, make sure both options are enabled:
   - *Provision Azure Active Directory Users*  
   - *Provision Azure Active Directory Groups*
3. Finally, set **Provisioning Status** to **On**.

Thatâ€™s itâ€”your users and groups in Entra ID will now stay in sync with Kinship automatically.

## Troubleshooting

If something doesnâ€™t work the first time, here are a few common things to check:

- **Test Connection fails**  
  - Double-check your Tenant URL. It should match exactly what you copied from Kinship.  
  - Make sure your SCIM token hasnâ€™t expired. If needed, [regenerate a token](#).

- **Users arenâ€™t syncing**  
  - Confirm that *Provision Azure Active Directory Users* is enabled under **Mappings**.  
  - Ensure the **Provisioning Status** toggle is set to **On**.

- **Groups arenâ€™t syncing**  
  - Check that *Provision Azure Active Directory Groups* is enabled.  
  - Verify that the groups you want to sync in Entra ID are assigned to the Kinship application.

- **Changes take time**  
  - Provisioning isnâ€™t instantâ€”Microsoft Entra ID runs provisioning on a scheduled cycle (usually every 40 minutes). Allow some time for changes to show up in Kinship.
