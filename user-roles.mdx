title: "User Roles"
description: "An overview of the roles available in your Kinship team, including the permissions and responsibilities each one carries."
---

Kinship includes five distinct user roles. Each role has specific permissions that determine what a user can see and do across your team's projects, content, and settings.

- **Owner** – Full control over your team, including billing and site-wide settings
- **Security Administrator** – Manages restricted projects, collections, and sensitive team settings
- **Administrator** – Manages users, projects, content, and general team settings
- **Content Manager** – Curates and organizes your team’s library and collections
- **Team Member** – Uses content and participates in projects, without admin permissions


## Owner

Owners have the highest level of access in Kinship. They can manage everything in your team’s site — including users, content, projects, and all team settings. Owners are also the only role with access to critical functions like updating billing details or shutting down the team.

You can assign up to five owners in your team. Having more than one is recommended to ensure continuity if someone leaves or loses access.

---

## Security Administrator

Security Administrators manage restricted projects, collections, and sensitive team settings. This role is optional and can be enabled if your team needs tighter control over access to confidential data.

When Security Administrators are enabled, regular Administrators lose access to restricted content and certain team settings. Only Security Administrators can view or manage restricted items, unless those items are explicitly shared with others.

This role is ideal when your team handles sensitive or high-security content that shouldn't be visible to all administrators.

---

## Administrator

Administrators can manage users, content, projects, and most team settings. They can invite and deactivate users, assign roles, create and organize content, and oversee your team’s projects.

If Security Administrators are enabled, regular Administrators lose access to restricted projects, collections, and certain sensitive settings. Otherwise, they have full access to everything except owner-only controls like billing and site shutdown.

Use this role for trusted users who help manage your team but don't need full ownership permissions.

---

## Content Manager

Content Managers are responsible for organizing and maintaining your team’s content. They can add, edit, remove, and share content, as well as manage the Library, Lists, and Team Collections.

They can view projects and users, and they have access to team settings related to content management and discovery. They don’t have permission to manage users, edit projects, or change core team settings.

Use this role for users who curate and maintain content, without needing broader administrative access.


---

## Team Member

Team Members can use content and participate in projects, but they don’t have any administrative permissions.

They can view and load content from the Library and Team Collections, and they can open models in assigned projects. They can also create and manage their own Personal Collections, which can be shared if needed.

This is the default role for most users in your team.

---

## Permissions Tables

<Note>
The tables below show permissions when Security Administrators are enabled.  
If your team doesn't use this role, Administrators have the same permissions as Sec Admins.
</Note>


### Projects

All users can view projects and open models.

Restricted projects are only visible to Sec Admins and users who are part of the project team.  
A user is added to a project team automatically when they perform a Sync with Central (SwC) on one of its models.

<Warning>
If Security Administrators are enabled, Administrators can't access restricted projects unless they’re part of the project team.
</Warning>

### Content

All users can search, view, and load content from the Library and from non-restricted Team Collections.

Content Managers can manage the Library and Team Collections. This includes editing content, organizing lists, and sharing collections. Use this role for users who curate and maintain your team’s content.

#### Library

- All users can view and load content from the Library and Team Collections.
- Team Members can suggest content for the Library. Suggestions appear in the *Pending Approval* section and must be approved by a Content Manager or Administrator before they become visible to the team.



| Library Activity                          | Team Member | Content Manager |     Admin     |     Sec Admin     |

#### Team Collections

- All members can view and load content from Team Collections. Restricted Team Collections are only visible to Security Administrators, and users who have been granted access, either by sharing the collection with them or by assigning it to a project they are part of. A user joins a project team automatically when they perform a Sync with Central (SwC) on one of its models.
- Content Managers can view and edit non-restricted Team Collections.
- Team Members can create and manage their own Personal Collections but can’t convert them into Team Collections.

<Warning>
When Security Administrators are enabled, Administrators can’t access restricted collections unless the collection is shared with them or assigned to a project they are part of.
</Warning>

<Tip>
You can grant view and edit access to specific users by sharing a collection with them.
</Tip>

<Tip>
In a collection’s settings, you can allow all team members to add and modify content. This lets everyone contribute without needing to share the collection individually. The setting applies only to that specific collection.
</Tip>
