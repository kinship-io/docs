# How-To Guide: Tracking a Revit Model in Kinship

Want to start tracking your Revit model with Kinship?  
Follow these steps to make sure your model, its content, and all project data stay up-to-date and accessible for your team.

## Quick Steps

1. **Synchronize with Central (SwC) in Revit**
    - If your model isn’t tracked yet, Kinship will prompt you:
        - **Track:** Adds the model for tracking.
        - **Do not track:** Kinship won’t prompt you again for this model.  
          _Tip: You can add it manually later—see step 4 below._
2. **Kinship captures and uploads content**
    - System and component families are uploaded automatically.
    - _Note: Groups, views, and sheets need manual upload._
3. **Model is assigned to a project**
    - Public models join an existing project or remain unassigned.
    - Restricted models create a new restricted project.
4. **Check sync status in Revit**
    - Click **Model Sync Status** on the Kinship ribbon to view the current sync state.
    - Sync outstanding changes manually or let Kinship sync when Revit is idle.
5. **View and analyze in Kinship web portal**
    - See sync history, model details, Revit version, warnings, and more.
    - Access crash logs, journals, and track content across projects and teams.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Local files aren’t tracked by default**  
  Kinship skips models saved to local drives (like `C:\`). To override, use **Model Sync Status** in the Kinship ribbon.
- **Admin rules may affect tracking**  
  Your admin can set rules to always/never add certain models based on their location. [Learn more about Model Sync Rules.](PLACEHOLDER_LINK)
- **Model extraction setting**  
  If “Disable family and model extraction” is checked in the add-in settings, Kinship will not prompt to track models.
- **Want to track a model later?**  
  Go to **Add-Ins** > Kinship panel > **Model Sync Status**. You’ll see the tracking dialog again.
