title: "Automate Model Tracking with Model Sync Rules"
description: "Learn how Model Sync Rules enable you to automate, standardize, and manage how new Revit models are tracked in Kinship—without manual prompts for every model."
---

## What are Model Sync Rules?

**Model Sync Rules** let you automate how Kinship handles new or updated central Revit models, based on the file’s location or name.
Instead of prompting users every time a new model is detected, you can create rules that decide what happens—automatically, every time.

---

## Why use Sync Rules?

- **Reduce manual work:** Avoid repeated prompts to add models.
- **Consistent project setup:** Ensure models are tracked the right way, every time.
- **Protect sensitive projects:** Prevent tracking of confidential or internal models.
- **Easy overrides for admins:** Administrators can always add models manually if needed.

---

## What actions can rules take?

Each rule matches a **path** or **filename pattern**, and assigns one of four actions:

| Action           | What it does                                                                                 |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Never**        | Never add matching models to Kinship. Users aren’t prompted. Only admins can override.       |
| **Auto Restricted** | Automatically add matching models as **restricted** (new restricted project).                      |
| **Auto Public**  | Automatically add matching models as **public** (assigned to a project or left unassigned).  |
| **Ask User**     | Show the default Kinship prompt (user decides, can set privacy).                             |

## How do rules work?

- **First-match wins:** Rules are checked from top to bottom. Only the *first* matching rule applies to each model.
- **Order matters:** You can drag and reorder rules to set their priority.
- **Delete or edit anytime:** Manage your list to match changing needs.

> **Note:**
> Kinship ignores central models on local drives (e.g. `C:\`) by default, assuming they’re not shared. Admins can add these models explicitly from the Model Sync Status menu in Revit.

---

## Rule Patterns

Rules use *simple matching* against **UNC paths or filenames** (not mapped drives).
A rule can match by path *or* filename, but not both at the same time.

**Examples:**
- `*secret*`
  Matches any filename or path containing “secret”.
- `*\eTransmit\*`
  Matches any model in any “eTransmit” folder or sub-folder.
- `\\SRV-LON\*`
  Matches any model stored on the server `SRV-LON`.

**Invalid:**
- `\\SRV-LON\*secret`
  Mixing path and filename in one rule won’t work.

---

## What if no rules match?

If no sync rule matches a model:
- Kinship will use its default behaviour: **Ask User** (prompt appears).
- To override this, add a final “catch-all” rule with pattern `*`.
  You can set to **Never** if you want to only allow listed models.

---

## Admin override

Even when a rule blocks tracking (`Never`), **administrators** can always add a model using the Model Sync Status panel in the Kinship Revit add-in.
